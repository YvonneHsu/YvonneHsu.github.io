Bodhi Linux is a minimalistic elegant and lightweight Ubuntu-based Linux distribution for Personal Computers. It inherits these qualities as it is comes with the Enlightenment Window Manager. Bodhi Linux 2.04 is based on the 12.04 LTS release of Ubuntu, thus it is expected to be supported till the month of October, 2017. Download Links will be provided at the end of the article. Let us now see if this Distro has enough in it's belt worthy of a Download. 

### Installation

Installation of Bodhi Linux 2.04 doesn't bring anything new to the table. It provides the same installation procedure as seen in regular Ubuntu distributions as it uses the same Installation tool -- Ubiquity.

On startup, you are given a choice among different preset User Interface profiles. You can choose any profile setup, from the minimalist bare setup to the fancy setup.

The Next step is to choose a theme. You are then taken to the Live Environment to test out the OS and install it.

Installation is quick as usual, after which you choose a profile and theme as you did earlier. We'll only review the Desktop profile setup.

Though Bodhi follows the usual Installation procedure to make it familiar with Ubuntu, it's post-installation setup ruins the fun as it seems as a repeatation of the setup while booting from live DVD. Thus we give a rating of 4/5 for installation.

### The Desktop Environment
As mentioned earlier, Bodhi uses the Enlightenment Window Manager, which gives a great look and feel to it. Compositing is available which can be enabled easily. Enlightenment is a complete module framework which serves various interface elements. It responds quickly and brings in excellent aesthetics to the interface.

![How the Desktop Looks?](/images/contentimages/ReviewofBodhiLinuxOS2.04/1.png)

The default desktop profile consists of a panel at the bottom called the *shelf*. The shelf can hold any number of items on it. By default, it holds the Start button, Midori Launcher, Tasks, Mixer, Pager, Clock and System Applets. However this may differ according to the profile and theme you have chosen. 

An unusual behaviour encouraged in Bodhi is the ability to launch the Start menu just by left-clicking the desktop. This can easily be changed by changing the relevant mouse bindings in *Start > Settings > Settings Panel > Input tab*. 

The mouse pointer proves itself very handy to use as it is set to adjust its position to the center of the active application window whenever the window is mapped or refocused. 

There are plenty of such hidden behaviours throughout Bodhi, which keeps the average joe interested in the OS. It deserves it's place as the most beautiful Linux distro among all.

The aesthetic appeal and visual treat provided by bodhi is more than enough for a rating of 5/5 for the Desktop Environment

### Applications
True to Bodhi's minimal but usable philosophy, it doesn't come with a truckload of Applications by default. This leaves the user with choice of installing applications that they prefer. By default, it comes with these applications:

* **EFM** -- File Manager
* **Leafpad** -- Text Editor
* **Midori** -- Web Browser
* **Screenshot** -- Screenshot Tool
* **Synaptic** -- Package Manager
* **Terminology** -- Terminal Client

Do not fret if you are an average Joe who doesn't know his favorite Applications. Just visit [Bodhi AppCenter](http://appcenter.bodhilinux.com/ "Bodhi AppCenter") from Midori and install either one of two Software Bundles:

* **Nikhila Application Set** -- An Application Suite of full featured software. 
* **Prathibha Application Set** -- An Application Suite that focuses on packages that are light on resources but high on functionality.

Although Bodhi lacks a lot of necessary applications giving preference to user choice, it gives an quick, albeit hidden way to install required applications. Thus we give a 4/5 for applications

### Apps and Workspace Switching
Switching between applications can be done using the usual Alt+Tab method.

Switching between workspaces can be done using the Pager applet on the Shelf. 

Though there are ways to switch between the Applications and Workspaces, there isn't any alternate ways of doing the same. Thus we give a 3/5 for Apps and Workspace Switching.

### Verdict
Bodhi Linux may not appeal to newbies as there is a lot of tinkering required to get the system to work the way they want. However, it is a delightful treasure for the tinkerers in you. Here is our ratings of Bodhi Linux OS 2.04:
