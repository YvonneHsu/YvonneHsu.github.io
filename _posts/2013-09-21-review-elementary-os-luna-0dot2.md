Elementary OS is a Linux distribution aimed at providing the best possible experience for it's community of users. It is a beautifully crafted OS with not only an elegantly designed User Interface, but also with highly responsive apps, safety and security of a Linux Kernel, lot of customization opportunities, and stability as it is based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Long Term Support) release.

Yes! Yes! I'll give you the Download link soon, but let's see what's in store for us in this stylish OS first.

### Installation
Installation of Elementary OS Luna is quite straight-forward. If you have installed any recent versions of Ubuntu, you'll feel right at home installing Luna as it uses the same Installation tool - Ubiquity. However, a notable missing feature during installation is the lack of slide-shows.  Installation should finish within around 15 minutes and you'll be ready to boot into Luna.

### The Desktop Environment
![How the Desktop looks?](/images/contentimages/ReviewofElementaryOSLuna0.2/1.jpeg)

Elementary OS Luna is powered by the Pantheon Desktop Environment, which is a modified form of the Gnome Shell. Although based on Gnome Shell, it does not have any quirks found in Gnome Shell. It has a panel called Wing-Panel at the top, and a Dock called Plank (based on Docky) at the bottom.

The Wing-Panel contains the Applications Launcher on it's left, the calender indicator in the middle, and  the Settings and Notifications Area on it's right.

Pantheon has the Gala Compositing Manager which brings elegance to the Desktop through modest and subtle animations throughout the Desktop. All Windows opened in Pantheon has only close button on the left and the Maximize button on the right. Plank can be used to pin applications, launch, switch and minimize applications.

### Applications
Luna comes with only a few pre-installed applications. The Applications shipped with Luna are:

![Applications Launcher after installing extra Applications](/images/contentimages/ReviewofElementaryOSLuna0.2/2.jpeg)

* **File Roller** -- Archive Manager
* **Geary** -- Email Client
* **GNOME Calculator** -- Calculator
* **Empathy** -- Internet Messenger
* **Maya** -- Calendar
* **Midori** -- Web Browser
* **Noise** -- Music Player
* **Pantheon Files** -- File Manager
* **Pantheon Terminal** -- Terminal Client
* **Scratch** -- Text Editor
* **Screenshot** -- Screenshot tool
* **Shotwell** -- Photo Manager
* **Simple Scan** -- Scan Application
* **Switchboard** -- System Settings
* **Totem** -- Movie Player
* **Ubuntu Software Center** -- Software Center
* **Update Manager** -- Updates Manager

Notable omissions in Luna Applications set are Office Applications, Disc Burning Application, Bit-torrent Application and a Graphic Manipulation Application. The user has to bear the extra burden of installing such applications along with Flash, Java and Multimedia Plugins.

However, the applications packed in Luna are of excellent choice in terms of responsiveness, usability and elegance. These lightweight applications in Luna gives a unique experience to the user.


### App and Workspace Switching

**In Luna, applications can be switched in these 2 methods**
  1. Traditional Alt-Tab method (Alt+Tab) 
  2. Overview (Scale mode) method (Super+W) 

App Switching is a pleasant experience in Luna with subtle animations.

Using Alt-Tab method shows scaled preview of available applications one after the other during which the Plank shows only the icons of these applications, so as to select using mouse.

Using Overview method shows scaled down previews of all available applications, after which the required application can be selected using mouse.

**Switching between Workspaces can be done in these 2 methods:**
  1. Using the key combination - (Super+Tab) 
  2. Using the key combination - (Super+S)

The first method just switches to the other workspaces left and right.

The second method opens a switching panel which can be used to switch between workspaces, move windows to other workspaces and close workspaces.
