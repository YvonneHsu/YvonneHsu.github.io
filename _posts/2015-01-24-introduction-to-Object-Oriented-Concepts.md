Before beginning the study of Java a brief introduction to object-oriented (OO) concepts is warranted. For those of you who are learning oo-programming (OOP) for the first time this discussion will provide you with the three main features of OOP.

###Inheritance

It’s exactly what it sounds like, a child will receive some property from the parent(s). How exactly does inheritance apply to OOP? Well here’s how. We have one **class** designated as parent and another **class** designated as child. (Don't worry about **classes** they will be explained shortly). As you've already guessed the child inherits properties from the parent. (OK but what exactly is it inheriting?). Well in the real-world we inherit monetary-property but the programs we write have no concept of money at all. But all programs consider one thing as valuable and that is **data**. So in OOP the child class inherits the data that the parent has. Exactly which data is inherited is a topic best left to further discussions where the basic concepts are clear.

###Encapsulation

I'm sure all of us have been sick at least a few times in our lives. What do we do when we're sick? We take medicine of-course. This medicine may be the form of capsules. The capsules themselves are hollow and contain the actual medicine inside them. The medicine has to be protected from exposure to harmful elements. So we **encapsulate** the medicine in a protective **capsule**.This is exactly what encapsulation means. But what would need protection in a program? As you would've probably guessed by now it's **data**. Data like the medicine has to be protected from being exposed to harmful situations where it may get corrupted. Hence we **encapsulate** the data in a **class** which protects the data. Like the capsule the class is useless by itself. A class is truly useful when it has some data inside it.

###Polymorphism

This sounds complicated right? Well it kind-of is but don't worry I'll explain it in a simple way. If you Google Polymorphism it gives you this meaning 

>  the condition of occurring in several different forms. 

Now what exactly is polymorphism? Where can we see it in real-life? I'm sure that at-least  some of you reading this article know how to swim. Once you learn how to swim the process of swimming remains the same whether you swim in the ocean or a swimming pool. There is not a special kind-of swimming for the ocean (or maybe there is and I don't know about it!). The swimming remains the same for the pool and the ocean. Similarly in programming we can consider operations on data.  The same operation can be performed on different kinds of data. We'll see how exactly this is accomplished in the articles that follow.
