It was once again that time of the year for the Librarian of Christ Junior College (Bangalore, India) to welcome the freshers to the College Library. Along with a bunch of newly met friends, standing in the queue to listen to the directions the Librarian gave was me. He showed us that one section that interested me the most -- The Computers Section. It was no surprise to see myself putting it to good use in the days to come.

I always liked the idea of blogging. Starting a blog was an easy decision to make. I jumped from one blogging site to another making useless posts that no one would be interested in. No blogger would want to stop blogging, but to have something to blog about is as important as owning a blog.

It was then that I noticed something. There was something different about some computers at the Library. They did not boot up to run Windows, but instead something called Ubuntu. It looked quite different. It had all these amazing animations and effects that I loved using. It was quite fast and responsive. My NCC friend Pavan (do a google search on pvnkmrksk) was generous enough to explain me about everything Ubuntu Linux did and how it was different from Windows. I got Linux Mint installed on my computer by the end of my 2 year old pre-university course before I left the college. I then started blogging about Linux.

Once in the year of 2012, I was checking out Linux Mint IRC channel to get some technical help. While waiting for my answer, I decided to help out others with my limited Linux knowledge. It was then that I met wei2912. He invited me into his channel. He had formed a small team of linux users who also went about helping others on IRC. We decided to create a place where we could help newbies by inviting them to this channel and teaching them basic Linux knowledge. It then grew into the NixTuts website (now deprecated).

Meanwhile, I decided to extend my blog to accomodate news related to Technology. I moved to a wordpress.com site and called my blog T-Surge. wei2912 made me realize the limitations of wordpress and the decision to move the website to GitHub Pages was made.
He helped me setup the website. Thus Tech-Yuga was created from the ashes of T-Surge. 

We sincerely hope that you enjoy reading our content. We'll strive to bring you the best of what we can offer.
